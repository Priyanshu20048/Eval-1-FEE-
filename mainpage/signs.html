    <h2>What are the signs of mental health issues?</h2>
    <p>Some of these signs may not be caused by a serious problem. Some could even be a normal part of life. If they don't seem to be going away after about 2 weeks, it's best to seek help.</p>

    <h2>Feeling anxious or worried</h2>
    <p>Most people get worried or stressed from time to time. Anxiety could be a sign of a mental health disorder if the worry is constant and interferes with your daily activities. It might lead someone to avoid certain situations.
    
        Physical symptoms of anxiety may include heart palpitations, shortness of breath, chest tightness, headache, sweating, trembling, feeling dizzy, restlessness or diarrhoea.
